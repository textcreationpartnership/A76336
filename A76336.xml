         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head type="sub">VVith many remarkable Paſſages and Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actious, during the Series of their lives, taken from their own Mouths, after their Condemnation.</head>
               <p>ONe main Reaſon which Induces us to publiſh this Melancholly Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the untimely ends of ſuch as have forfeited their Lives to offend Juſtice, by breaking the known Laws, is to deter others from ſuch raſh and lawleſs Enterprizes, as muſt inevitably end in their Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in and diſgrace; with which, frequent Examples furniſh the word, of which, after many precedent, take the following.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>William Blower</hi> Chirurgion, of the Pariſh of St. <hi>Allhallows Barkin,</hi> being Tryed upon an Indictment of <hi>High Treaſon,</hi> for Cliping, Fileing, and Defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Lawful and Current Coin of this Kingdom, and upon proof that Clipings, and Cliping-Inſtruments were found in his houſe found Guilty and received Sentence of Death on the 18th of <hi>July;</hi> when returning to, <hi>Newgate</hi> he betook himſelf to his retirement, and for a time was much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected and diſcontented in Sighs and Groans, deploring his ſad misfortune, but being comforted by the wholeſome Advice of ſuch Reverend Divines, as in Chriſtian Charity came to fit and prepare him for another World; laying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide all thoughts of any long continuance in this; and looking upon himſelf as a dying man, he betook himſelf to Prayer and Meditation, confeſſing the depravity of his Nature, and acknowledging himſelf to be a Sinner in a high degree: they earneſtly preſſed him to lay open the ſecrets of his Heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the great God of Heaven; and with all Humility and Proſtration to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:170996:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>humble himſelf, and implore Mercy and Forgiveneſs, through the Merits of our Bleſſed Saviour who laid down his Life for Sinners; laying before him the Penitence of <hi>David,</hi> the Patience of <hi>Job,</hi> the humble and ſubmiſſive Expreſſions of the <hi>Prodigal</hi> in his return; the Expreſſion of the Penitent Goaler, and the dying words of the Thief upon the Croſs; the ſorrow of <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> and divers Recorded in Sacred writ, for true Penitents, and unfeigned Converts, aſſuring him that God, in the Name and for the ſake of his beloved Son, our ever Bleſſed Saviour, is at all times willing to accept of thoſe that repent, and turn from the evil of their ways, and that he will in no wiſe rejeect the humble, and thoſe that are of a broken and contrite Spirit, admoniſhing him to try and examine himſelf, for the good and well-fare of his Immortal Soul, of more value than the whole World, and therefore ought to be highly priſed above what he could think or imagine, not regarding what became of his Body, ſo that ineſtimable Jewel arrived ſafe at the Hea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>venly <hi>Canaan,</hi> and that a bare belief that Chriſt ſhed his precious Blood to ſave him was not ſufficient, but that he muſt wholly caſt himſelf upon him; counting himſelf altogether unworthy of any favour at the hands of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, whom he many ways highly offended, but in and through the Merits of his Bleſſed Son, who ſhed his precious Blood to attone for the ſins of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
               <p>After theſe, and many the like pious Expreſſions, a worthy Divine proceeded to ask him how it fared with him, and how he found himſelf, as to his State in another World, requiring him to give him an Account what aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance or hope he had, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to which, with much meekneſs and humility he replyed, that at firſt, <hi>viz.</hi> Immediately after his Condemnation, he found great ſtrugling within himſelf, and laboured under ſtrange Temptations, his heart not being plyable as it ought, but that he had earneſtly laboured to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come them, and reduce himſelf to a calm and plyable temper, fit to take the Impreſſions of ſaving Grace, but could not ſoon prevail; yet after much ſerious and fervent Prayer to Almighty God, to ſtrengthen and enable him to reſiſt and overcome the Tempter; he found the Tempeſt or ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in hir Soul allayed, and ſucceeded by a ſedate calmneſs, which ever ſince continued to his great comfort; acknowledging that he had been a great ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and that for his perſeverance in many known ſins, God had ſuffered him to fall under this affliction: Then being asked by the Reverend Divine, whether he uſed not Prayer and reading the Holy Scripture, he anſwered that the hurry of Buſineſs had of late made him ſomwhat remiſs in thoſe Holy Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tys, but that he was exceeding ſorry for his neglect, beging pardon of God for ſuch his neglect. After theſe and divers other ſacred admonitions, they prayed with him, beſeeching the Almighty to give him a true ſenſe of his ſins, and a heart ſincerely to repent: That he would par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don his former Tranſgreſſions, and have mercy upon his precious and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Soul. When after ſome other neceſſary Exhortations and an Application of what had been urged, he left him in a calm temper of mind, altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaken by fear of approaching Death, but rather expreſſing a kind of a joy, or a lacritie that God had made him ſenſible of his latter end, and given him knowledge of the certain Number of his days.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Robert Francis,</hi> of the Pariſh of St. <hi>Andrews Holbourn</hi> Indicted the ſame <hi>Seſſions</hi> as the former; upon his Tryal was found Guilty of wilful Murther, for giving <hi>Thomas Dangerfield</hi> a Wound in the Eye, <hi>with</hi> a little <hi>ſtick</hi> on the 4th. of <hi>July,</hi> of which Wound he dyed in <hi>Newgate,</hi> on the 5th of the ſame Month, for which, receiving Sentence of Death on the 18th. and being returned to the <hi>Preſs-yard</hi> he began ſeriouſly to conſider what he had done, becoming more Melancholly than ever, and as muh as ſtood with conveniency, retired from company, ſeriouſly reflecting upon his latter end, ſaying, what he had done was raſhly,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:170996:2"/>and altogether without any premeditated Malice, that he was unfortunately coming along and preſſed into the Croude out of curioſity to ſee the Priſoner, of whom he had little or no knowledge only by report, and that an unhappy word paſſing, he puſhed at him with his <hi>Cane,</hi> not imagining it would have proved of fatal conſequence; ſaying, that he had lived in credit and reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not being given to quarrel, nor tranſported with paſſion to a degree of miſchiefeing any perſon before this unhappy Accident, hoping the God of Mercys would pardon his ſins: As for Death, altho' it ſhould be his misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to fall untimely, yet he would chearfully ſubmit to what the Laws infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted on him, giving much heed to ſuch as admoniſhed him to be mindful of his future ſtate, often reading and meditating both before and after he had notice a Warrant was ſigned for his Execution, expreſſing a calm temper and quiet of mind, ſpeaking chearfully to ſuch as daily come to viſit him, deſiring them not to be troubled or concerned at his mirfortune, ſince it was befallen him and could not now be remedied; and that he was ſenſibly ſorry for what he had done, notwithſtanding the deceaſed was a perſon of Evil Fame, ſaying, that he hoped it would be a warnging to others, thereby to hinder them from ſuch raſh and unadviſed Action; and ſo continued as one extreamly ſenſible of his latter end.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Henry Anthony,</hi> being found Guilty as the former, for breaking open the houſe of one Mr. <hi>Trevor</hi> in the Pariſh of St. <hi>Catherines,</hi> on the 23d. of <hi>June</hi> laſt, and ſtealing three Gold-Rings, a Silk-Hood, and other things of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue; himſelf being taken in the Fact. After his return to <hi>Newgate,</hi> promiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf a Security of Life, as is imagined by thoſe that viſited him, he appeared not to be ſo ſenſible of his latter end as a perſon in his condition ought; notwithſtanding to ſuch queſtions as were propoſed by divers vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitants, he chearfully anſwered ſaying, he had been well educated and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully brought up, but being of a rambling Nature, as ſoon as he was capable he betook himſelf to the Seas enterprizing divers Voyages to <hi>Spain, France,</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> making good returns, ſuitable to his Station, but being out of em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy as to Maritim affairs and his mony growing ſhort, he betook himſelf to evil courſes, being rather perſwaded thereto, than any way prompted by his Natural Inclinations, adding, that he had conſiderable Relations, but was willing to conceal their Names, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> leaſt his diſgraceful end ſhould any ways reflect upon their Reputation, confeſſing he had been guilty of many Capital Sins, and would not be reclaimed neither by ſeverity nor civil per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, but following his own headſtrong reſolution he by haunting ſuch Houſes as were frequented by bad Company, he was drawn in to portake with them in their unlawful Enterpriſes, one Sin calling on another, ſo that in the end he was hardened in Iniquity ſcoffing at and diſpiſeing good Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions, which if he had ſeriouſly regarded would have prevented the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief that was befallen him, but ſeeing time was paſt he muſt make the beſt on it, and bear it as patiently as he could hoping God would give him ſtrength to go through it: and that although he had offended him in a high Nature, he would in his laſt Extreamity give him Comfort and have pitty on his Soul, and that it might go well with him in the other World. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired the Prayers of all good Chriſtians whilſt he was yet Alive, being in the End very attentive to thoſe that gave him good advice relateing to his Immortal State: But could hardly be induced to pray for himſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>John Morgan,</hi> Tryed the ſame Seſſions as the former and found Guilty, for breaking open the Houſe of one Mr. <hi>Filkins</hi> of the Pariſh of St. <hi>Leonard Shoreditch,</hi> on the 30th. of <hi>June</hi> laſt, and ſtealing two Cloth Coats, a pair of Breeches, a Crape Gown and other things the goods of the ſaid <hi>Filkins,</hi> upon his being returned to Newgate, confeſſed himſelf to be an notorious Sinner, and that after his providential Eſcaping many dangers, God had
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:170996:3"/>ſuffered him at laſt to fall into the Snare: Being asked whether he was drawn in to committ this Robery by the Alurments of bad Company: he ſaid he never kept any Company that was ſo bad as himſelf, he having been an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy proficient in moſt Vices, which had in a manner hardened his Heart and obliterated the fear of Death due to his many Crimes, yet he was not left altogether without hope, for he was ſenſible God was a merciful God, though he had but ſmall reaſon to expect it at his hands, whom he had ſo highly diſhonoured in the Series of his Life, which was now come in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to a Period, and he beleived this had befallen him to give him a ſight and ſenſe of his Sins. For the Almighty had as he had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> often been informed wonderous ways to bring preverſe Wretches home to himſelf, and humble them for their paſt Failings, as for the fear of Death he ſaid it little troubled him, for he knew he muſt Die, and to be ſo cut off was but to go out of the World a little ſooner than ordinary though he could have been content it had been otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>This being the material ſubſtances of what they were Condemned, for the manner of their Behaviour and Diſcourſe <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In Newgate the ſix days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Sentance <hi>[viz.]</hi> on <hi>Friday</hi> the 24th. of this inſtant <hi>July,</hi> about 10 in the Morning were brought out of the Goal and delivered to the Sherifs Officers, who in the uſual manner conveyed them to Tyburn the place of Execution, <hi>viz.
